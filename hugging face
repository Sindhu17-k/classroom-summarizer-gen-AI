In today's class, we discussed the basics of Thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed,
only converted from one form to another. We also covered the concept of internal energy, heat transfer, and work done by a system.
Next, we looked at different types of thermodynamic processes such as isothermal, adiabatic, and isobaric processes.
Students were encouraged to solve example problems from the textbook to reinforce their understanding.
